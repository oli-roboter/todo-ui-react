# todo-ui-react
frontend in react for todoodler app

Frontend react application as part of the microservice architecture to be deployed on an aws server


//TO DO:
- TODO CARD and display in correct area of window depending on date
- PATCH TODO
- DELETE TODO

- Think of the best way to handle adding a todo and displaying on screen:
  -> Should run query in background and get all data + newly added todo ?
  -> Should push new todo into frontend array and rerender screen ?
  -> Think about notification service if 2 users are using app at the same time
